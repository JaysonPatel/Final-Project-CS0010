### Abstract
The goal of this final project is to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh by manipulating CSV datasets.  Our group decided to pick the above datasets because they reflect a neighborhoods safety and accessability to people from different walks of life.  The best and safest neighborhood must have low amounts of arrests and fires while having a large amount of ADA accessable playground equipment.  We believe that through these metrics, we were able to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
